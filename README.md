## SYST10049 Web Development - Assignment 1
Program: **Computer Programming @ Sheridan College** <br>
Note: The following assignment was completed during Semester 1 (2023) <br>
Languages: HTML, CSS 

## The Task:
In this assignment, students were to design web pages for an online speciality store. The store must specialize in a particular product or type of product that the student have some kind of personal interest in. Try to make it specialized enough so that there is no other exisiting store quite like it. 

## Details: 
1. index.html - welcomes the user to the store, provides links to other content areas including an about page and shopping cart, contains contact information at the bottom of the page, and features at least three current deals with clickable links to addd to the cart or get more information (these links don't have to go anywhere for real).
2. about.html - should say something about the store, its history, its mission, the products it sells, pictures of the staff with bios, etc. It should have links back to the index.html and shopping cart pages.
3. cart.html - should be a mock-up of what a typical user's shopping cart might look like. The cart should contain at least three items. There should be links somewhere on the page that take the user back to the index.html or to the about.page.

## Thoughts/Comments: 
When the professor said we were able to do basically whatever product, I knew I wanted to do a furniture store like Ikea. I remember drafting a rough idea of what I wanted this website to look like and I am super happy with the way things turned out. If you have not noticed yet, I am a big Studio Ghibli fan.
